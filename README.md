# CentrifugalCompressorV1

Version 1 of my 3D printed turbo compressor.  There are some mistakes that don't make this a super efficient design, and it's not optimized for use in an automotive application.

I printed everything out of PLA+, the compressor wheel should be printed at the lowest layer height your printer can comfortably print, and at slow print speeds 30-35mm/sec.

Disclaimer:  Not responsible for injuries caused by this, please wear safety glasses when testing this.  There is always a risk of flying scrapnel.
